        <h2>About CSS</h2>

        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design
            language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control
            the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs,
            how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used,
            layout designs, variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
            as well as a variety of other effects.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
            presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the
            markup languages HTML or XHTML.
